# **üìù Full-Stack Blog with Next.js, MongoDB & Tailwind CSS**  

This is a full-stack blog application built with **Next.js**, featuring **MongoDB** integration for dynamic content management. The project includes an **admin panel** that allows administrators to **create, delete, and manage blog posts**, as well as **view registered user emails**.  

The application is **fully responsive**, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices. **Tailwind CSS** was used for styling, providing a clean and modern UI with utility-first classes. To enhance performance, I implemented **motion animations** for fluid navigation and **optimized images** to reduce loading times. Additionally, **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) were used for efficient state management, while **Axios** handles API requests seamlessly.
